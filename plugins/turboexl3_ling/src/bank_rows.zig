// is the plugin's refusal by name"), and its room for the bank (`driver.zig` `streamRoomAt`) holds one prompt of 16K + 1K.
// So the bank reads what the host has really allocated, KV included, from its headroom (`Host.memoryCeiling`: the
// host's ceiling less what is resident), and plans each phase from it, as the model plugin's RQ did (C5, main's ruling
// 2026-11-11):
// - a prompt forward whose headroom holds less than one slot row (the pass is at the host's ceiling) is under the base
//   and refused by name, before its calls run;
// - a decode or trim plan under the base by at most the rows `free_ram` covers keeps the bank at its base with a named
//   warning; past that cover it is refused by name;
// - a decode plan above the base grows to at most the decode rows the headroom holds past `free_ram` (a trim below the
